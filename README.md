## Motivation
In today’s fast-paced world, effective time management and organization are critical for success. Many students and professionals struggle to maintain consistency, track deadlines, and analyze their productivity patterns. Existing task management solutions are often too complex, lack meaningful analytics, or fail to provide actionable insights.
This project was motivated by the need for a **lightweight, user-friendly, and interactive platform** that empowers users to plan their tasks intelligently while tracking their progress over time. By combining a simple task creation interface with detailed analytics, users gain insights into their productivity trends, identify strong and weak days, and adjust their schedules accordingly. The application emphasizes simplicity, visual clarity, and actionable feedback to encourage consistent progress and efficient time management.
